# Elevator Simulator Project

## Overview

This Elevator Simulator project is designed to showcase various object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, including inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, and exception handling. Additionally, the project utilizes FXML for the graphical user interface.

## Features

- **Inheritance:** The project demonstrates the use of inheritance by implementing a hierarchical structure for the elevator and related classes.

- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is applied to hide the internal details of the elevator system and only expose necessary functionalities through well-defined interfaces.

- **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism is employed to handle different types of requests, allowing flexibility and extensibility in the system.

- **Abstraction:** Abstraction is achieved through the creation of abstract classes and interfaces, providing a high-level view of the elevator system.

- **Exception Handling:** The project incorporates exception handling to handle unexpected situations, ensuring robustness and reliability.

- **FXML:** The graphical user interface is implemented using FXML, providing a declarative way to design the user interface and separate it from the application logic.
